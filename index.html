    <h1>PARAGRAPH ON CHRISTMAS</h1>
    <br>
    <p> <strong>Christmas </strong> is a vibrant and popular festival celebrated around the world. 
        Christmas is celebrated <strong>on December 25 </strong> every year. We visit our friends and 
        relatives during the Christmas holidays and have lots of fun. 
        My brother and I always wait for the Christmas vacation because it is filled 
        with joy and sweet treats.
